# Welcome!

This is Xintao Ding's personal webiste. I'm a second-year MA student in Biomedical Informatics. I have an interest in clinical informatics, specifically in how we can use EHR data to help transform the healthcare landscape to deliver better value to patients. 

You can find a resume [here](about.html)

# This is just some of the things I learn in my major

# Don't have a lot of personal life going on right now. Hence this webiste is for academic only
